\section{Construction for One Dimensional Systems}

We propose as the cocycle attractor a family of bounded, compact sets of
the form $A(t) = f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is a smooth continuous function.
From this we attempt to define a non-autonomous system with exponential
attraction to this proposed cocycle attractor.

Consider

\begin{equation}
  \dot{x} = - x + f(t) + f'(t)
\label{sys}
\end{equation}

Solving we get

\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{dt}[x e^t] & = e^t[f(t) + f'(t)] \\
  (xe^t)|_{t_0}^{t} & = \int_{t_0}^{t}e^tf(t)dt +
                \int_{t_0}^{t}e^tf'(t)dt \\
  xe^t - x(t_0)e^{t_0} & = (e^tf(t))|_{t_0}^{t} - \int_{t_0}^{t}e^tf'(t)dt
                + \int_{t_0}^{t}e^tf'(t)dt \\
  x(t) & = f(t) + [x(t_0) - f(t_0)]e^{-(t-t_0)} \\
\end{align*}

To see that $A(t) = f(t)$ is a cocycle attractor for the system
(\ref{sys}), consider the pullback properties of solutions to time $t_0$.

\[ x(t^*,t_0-t^*,x_0) = f(t_0) + [x_0 - f(t_0-t^*)]e^{-t^*} \]

then if we place the restriction that the function $f(t)$ is
subexponentially bounded, i.e. $\lim_{|t| \to \infty}e^{-\alpha|t|}f(t) =
0$, $\forall \alpha > 0$, we have solutions converging exponentially
towards the proposed cocycle attractor. Also that solutions originating on
$f(t)$ are invariant.

\section{Varying the Exponential Convergence Rate}

To increase the exponential rate at which the solutions converge to the
attractor consider the equation (\ref{sys}) slightly modified as follows

\begin{equation}
  \dot{x} = - \alpha x + \alpha f(t) + f'(t)
\label{sysa}
\end{equation}

Solutions to this are then of the form

\[ x(t^*,t_0-t^*,x_0) = f(t_0) + [x_0 - f(t_0-t^*)]e^{-\alpha t^*} \]
