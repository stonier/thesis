\begin{defn}[Diffeomorphism]
Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. A mapping $f:U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is
called a $C^r$ \textbf{diffeomorphism} if it is invertible, and
both $f$, and $f^{-1}$ are continuous and $r$-differentiable.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an open set and $f:U \to
\mathbb{R}^n$ a $C^1$ diffeomorphism. A point $x_0$ is said to be
a \textbf{hyperbolic fixed point} of $f$ if $f(x_0) = x_0$ and the
eigenvalues of $Df(x_0$ lie off the unit circle. The sum of the
generalized eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues inside
(reps. outside) is called the \emph{stable} (resp. unstable)
subspace and is denoted $E^s$ (resp. $E^u$).
